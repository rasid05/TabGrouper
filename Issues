1️⃣ First-seen subdomain naming
If studio.youtube.com opens first:
Group name becomes studio
Later youtube.com joins it
Acceptable for v1, but:
Easy fix later (rename on root detection)

2️⃣ No auto-group on open (yet)
Manual click is fine for MVP
Auto-group can be Phase-2.

3️⃣ No user customization
No rules, toggles, or preferences yet
Again — correct to skip in v1.
